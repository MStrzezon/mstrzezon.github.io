## üéØ Overview

Flylytics is a web application designed for analyzing aircraft trajectories from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) data. Built with Streamlit, it provides aviation enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals with powerful tools for flight data visualization and analysis.

### Data Management

Users can upload their own ADS-B data files in CSV, JSON, or Parquet formats that are traffic object from the library [traffic](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic)

### Trajectory Analysis

Users can analyze trajectories of loaded traffic:
- **2D Visualization**: Interactive 2D maps displaying flight paths. Trajectories can be colored by hour of the day, altitude, speed, callsign, weekday, or aircraft type.
