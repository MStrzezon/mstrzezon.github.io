## About me!
I am studying Computer Science at [AGH- University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/). Currently I am working on Physicist's Toolbox with my team and I am learning a lot of useful skills.

In my free time, I am [playing football](https://www.laczynaspilka.pl/zawodnik-sezon/michal-strzezon,2020-2021,849671.html) at the soccer club, watching football games and meeting with my friends!
