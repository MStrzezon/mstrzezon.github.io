## Physicist's Toolbox - first project.

Physicist's Toolbox App has really intuitive interface. First thing you come across during using it is the main menu where you can pick a field in Physics in which You are interested in. You can choose between:
- Kinematics
- Dynamics
- Thermodynamics
- Gravitation
- Electrostatics
- Optics

When You chose appropriate field, you can pick up needed function among listed ones. In order to do so, You have to type *one* digit, which is allocated to this certain function.

Our team has carefully selected the most problematic issues to put into the app. In case we did not cover the function which are You looking for, let us know!

## About me!
I am studying Computer Science at [AGH- University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/). Currently I am working on Physicist's Toolbox with my team and I am learning a lot of useful skills.

In my free time, I am playing football at the soccer club, watching football games and meeting with my friends!
